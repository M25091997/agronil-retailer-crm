                    Order Cancellation
                </h4>
                <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; color:#868889; margin-bottom:15px;">
                    Customers may cancel their orders within <strong>24 hours</strong> of placing them, provided the
                    order has not already been processed, packaged, or shipped. If the cancellation request is raised
                    after this timeframe, we may not be able to honor the request since the product may already be on
                    its way. To initiate cancellation, customers must contact our customer support team via phone or
                    email with their order details, including the order ID and registered email address. Once verified,
                    our team will confirm the cancellation. If the order has been shipped, cancellation may not be
                    possible, but customers can explore return or refund options outlined below.

                    Certain conditions may prevent customers from being eligible for refunds. These include:

                <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.7; color:#868889; margin-bottom:15px;">
                    Once a refund request is approved, Agronil Retailer will initiate the process immediately. Refunds
                    will be credited to the customer’s original mode of payment, whether bank account, credit card,
                    debit card, or digital wallet. The timeframe for receiving the refund may vary depending on the
                    banking partner or payment gateway, but typically, customers can expect refunds within <strong>7–10
                        business days</strong>. Agronil Retailer will provide confirmation once the refund is processed.
                    In some cases, additional documentation or verification may be required to complete the process.

                    Instead of a refund, customers may choose to exchange a defective or incorrect product for a
                    replacement. The replacement product will be shipped at no additional cost once the returned product
                    is received and inspected. This option ensures that customers receive the correct or fully
                    functional product without delay. Exchanges are subject to stock availability.
